A good person treats other people with respect, care, and compassion. Respect shows that an individual
 values and views the other person as a worthy human being who deserves respect. Compassion is a quality
  that enables people to identify with other peopleâ€™s suffering (Gelven 27). It motivates people to offer
   help in order to alleviate the suffering of others. A good person has compassion for others and finds
    ways to help people who are suffering. Showing compassion for the suffering makes them happy.
It promotes empathy, understanding, and support. In addition, good people are forgiving. They do not
 hold grudges and let go of anger that might lead them to hurt others. They think positively and focus
  their thoughts on things that improve their relationships (Needleman 33). They avoid thinking about
   past mistakes or wrongs done by others. Instead, they think of how they can forgive and move on.
A good person is honest and trustworthy. This implies that they avoid all situations that might hurt
the other person, such as telling lies, revealing secrets, and gossiping (Needleman 34). As such, their
 character or personality cannot be doubted because they do not harbor hidden intentions.
